id: PROS_HYPERVOCALIZATION_01
name: "Hypervocalization (rheme-focused)"
modality: prosody
cue_type: package
description: >
  A prosodic package that increases vocal effort to highlight informational prominence.
  It is intended to be anchored to the rheme and realized as slower speech rate with higher
  intensity (and often expanded pitch range), increasing the perceptual salience of the marked segment.

intent_links:
  - intent: emphasis
    confidence: high
    notes: "Package designed to increase prominence of the rheme without changing propositional content."

  Implementation can be approximated via TTS controls (e.g., SSML/vendored prosody tags) that adjust
  rate, loudness, and pitch; exact mapping is system-dependent.
