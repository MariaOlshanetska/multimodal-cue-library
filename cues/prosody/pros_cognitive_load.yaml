name: "Cognitive load / planning trouble"
modality: prosody
cue_type: package
description: >
  A prosodic package intended to convey cognitive load or online planning difficulty.
  Typical correlates include reduced speech rate, increased pausing, and (optionally) the insertion
  of restarts or self-repairs. In this library, the package is treated as a marked signal of
  uncertainty/planning effort rather than as an affective stance.

    confidence: high
    notes: "Signals planning difficulty or reduced confidence; often invites patience or clarification."

  ``Many restarts'' is not encoded as a separate parameter in v0.1; it can be implemented upstream
  (text planning) via self-repair fragments or hesitation tokens when experimental design requires it.
