# Multimodal Cue Library

This repository contains an exploratory library of atomic non-linguistic
communicative cues designed for controlled multimodal experiments and
human–agent interaction.

The library is organized as:
- one YAML file per cue
- a shared schema describing required fields
- explicit annotation of intent, context, and predicted perceptual outcomes
